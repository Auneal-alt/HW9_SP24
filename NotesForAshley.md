Marlesha Ellis and I(Austin Neal) Collaborated on this assignment. After much struggle I did recruit the aid of a student who took it last year to help guide me on my second go.
Explanation: Truss_stem.py was our main code that we manipulated and after many hours barely got anything to show up, there is a picture of the outcome of it TrussAttempt1.PNG
Truss_stem2.py was our second attempt with help of the past classmate. I got the nodes and node titles to the right place and the background to be green but no beams or lists. Also a picture of outcome.
We couldnt get the base code to run properly so we didnt get time to edit the code to add in the Rigid pivots or links. Sorry for the long explanation thankyou for reading all of this.
